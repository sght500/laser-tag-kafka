# Setup Process from A to Z

In this setup process we'll start from the begining to the end in the current state of the project.

We already have too many corrections to the setup process, thus a clean setup process from scratch can help.

## Clean up previous docker containers

We have already created some containers and netoworks. Let's clean them up to start fresh.

Stop and remove the kafka container

```bash
sudo docker stop kafka
sudo docker rm kafka
```

Remove the kafka-net network

```bash
sudo docker network rm kafka-net
```



If you haven't created that docker container, don't worry. This is just a clean up step.

## Create a docker container for kafka

We will need the [docker compose](docker-compose.yml) file with the kafka service.

Create the kafka-net network

```bash
sudo docker network create kafka-net
```

Create the [docker compose](docker-compose.yml) file in your home directory

```bash
mkdir ~/kafka
cd ~/kafka
nano docker-compose.yml
```

Copy/paste the content of the file and edit the line:

```
      - KAFKA_CFG_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS=PLAINTEXT://192.168.0.9:9092
```

Replace the IP address `192.168.0.9` with the IP address of your linux box at your home network.

### Clean up any previous docker compose

This is a clean up step. Don't worry if it doesn't work.

```bash
sudo docker compose down -v
```

Check for any lingering kafka process

```bash
sudo docker ps -a|grep kf
sudo docker ps -a|grep ka
```

## Continue with docker compose

Let's run the container.

**Remember:** You're in your home directory where your `docker-compose.yml` file is.

```bash
sudo docker compose up -d
```

Check the kafka log and validate kafka is running.

```bash
sudo docker logs kafka
```

Look for a line similar to this one:

```
[2025-04-16 19:06:48,466] INFO [KafkaRaftServer nodeId=1] Kafka Server started (kafka.server.KafkaRaftServer)
```

## Test topic and test messages

Let's create a test topic and send a test message. There's no python interaction at this time.

```bash
sudo docker exec -itunobody kafka bash
kafka-topics.sh --create --topic test-topic --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1
```

Send a test message

```bash
kafka-console-producer.sh --topic test-topic --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
```

Write something like `Hello there!` and press `<Enter>`. Then press `<Ctrl>-C`

Receive the test message

```bash
kafka-console-consumer.sh --topic test-topic --from-beginning --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
```

Check that your test message shows up and then press `<Ctrl>-C`

Remove the `test-topic`

```bash
kafka-topics.sh --delete --topic test-topic --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
```

## Create the `game-events` topic and test with python

This is the real topic we're going to use in the project. Let's create it and send a test message with python.

Create the `game-events` topic.

```bash
kafka-topics.sh --create --topic game-events \
  --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
  --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1 \
  --config retention.ms=1200000 \
  --config cleanup.policy=delete
```

This creates the `game-events` topic with a retention policy of 20 minutes. This is just fine because here we want only real-time messages in this topic.

Test the `game-events` topic with python.

In your **Visual Studio Code** in your Windows machine, run the [`producer01.py`](producer01.py). The result should be a line like this one:

```
âœ… Message delivered to game-events [0]
```

Still in **Visual Studio Code**, run the [`consumer04.py`](consumer04.py). The result should be a line like this one:

```
ðŸ“© Received message: player1 - move-up
```

On both files there's a line with the IP address of my linux box:

```python
SERVER = '192.168.0.9'
```

Be sure to change that IP address with the IP address of your own linux box at your home network.

## Create the `game-maze` topic

We need another topic for the maze in the game. We want the different players to have the same map of the maze.

This will prevent the players to spawn inside a wall's brick in another player's maze.

```bash
kafka-topics.sh --create --topic game-maze \
  --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
  --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1 \
  --config retention.ms=3600000 \
  --config cleanup.policy=delete,compact
```

This topic has a retention policy of 1 hour and compaction method. This is fine because a game normally takes 10 minutes to complete and we only need the last value of the `map` key and the last value of the `last-activity` key.

## List the topics you've created

So far, we've created two topics. Let's list them to verify that.

```bash
kafka-topics.sh --list --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
```
